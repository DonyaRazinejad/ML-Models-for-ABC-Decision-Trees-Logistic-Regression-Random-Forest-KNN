Exploring Machine Learning Models for ABC: Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and KNN

For our team's capstone project, focused on inventory control for ABC categorization, I contributed to backend development. We employed diverse machine learning algorithms like Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to enhance our model's efficacy. After rigorous testing, we identified the most accurate model for product categorization.
